# :warning: currently under development

"Zapping" through videos may cause memory leakage (i.e. the browser may crash).

It may also happen due to long sessions.

Close and open the browser as a last resort.

I'm sorry for the inconveniences but this extension has been developed in relatively few time and things tend to change frequently at this point ([see more](https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/15zs7f4/youtube_premium_required_is_youtube_becoming_the/)).

I will try to fix it as soon as changes occur. 

## Experimental features
Remember: reload the extension or restart the browser to apply the changes!

By clicking on the extension's icon, the user can choose to:

1 -  **[DISCOURAGED] automatically adjust the video quality** after ads removal (because sometimes YouTube returns the lowest quality after the removal

2 - **[SUGGESTED] automatically bring back the video to the right time** after ads removal (as for the previous point but restarting the video instead);

**These functions are still experimental** and they may be buggy. In particular, following the same order:

1 - It sometimes doesn't adjust the video quality and the info box does not disappear (simply refreshing the page shoud fix the problem)

2 - It always works but, at the moment, if the user is watching a video and returns to its beginning, the extension will reload the page but with the last (greatest) time.
