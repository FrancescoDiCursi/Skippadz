# YT-ads-auto-skipper
:warning: DISABLE ANY AD BLOCK ON YOUTUBE TO MAKE IT WORK.

‚ÑπÔ∏è An extension to automatically skip ads.
____
## :warning: currently in development
It sometimes doesn't work with unskippable ads. In this case click a couple of times on a blank spot on the page then reload the page.

If it doesn't work, try to reload the extension.

Otherwise just accept that you'll have to see ads sometimes üòí (luckly the unskippable ads are usually way shorter than the skippable ones!).
