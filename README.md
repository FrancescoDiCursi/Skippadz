# Skippadz

ℹ️ An extension to automatically skip ads.

❗ DISABLE ANY AD BLOCK ON YOUTUBE TO MAKE IT WORK.

## :warning: currently in development
It sometimes doesn't work with unskippable ads. In this case click a couple of times on a blank spot on the page then reload the page.

If it doesn't work, try to reload the extension.

Otherwise just accept that you'll have to see ads sometimes 😒 (luckly the unskippable ads are usually way shorter than the skippable ones!).
